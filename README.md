# Background

Slime Guy throws the user straight into slime action. After committing countless horrendous crimes against humanity, Slime Guy was banished to the deepest darkest depths of Hell. It is up to the player to decide if Slime Guy survives and redeems himself, otherwise Slime Guy more like Slime Die.

  From the beginning of the project I wanted to be able to style every asset in my game using CSS, with that in mind everything you see on the screen is a div, lol. The above GIF shows what's going on behind the scenes and allows you to see the game update live.
